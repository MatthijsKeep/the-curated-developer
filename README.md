## Introduction

This repository is a personal collection of the best tools and resources I've found or used in my development career. It's a living document that I update regularly as I discover new and interesting things that help me be a better developer. I try to not mention the obvious things. 

## Python Resources

- [Awesome Python](https://github.com/MatthijsKeep/the-curated-developer/tree/main/python/awesome-python) - A curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries, software, and resources.

## Terminal Tools

- [Starship](https://github.com/MatthijsKeep/the-curated-developer/tree/main/terminal/starship) - The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell.
- [Git-cz](https://github.com/MatthijsKeep/the-curated-developer/tree/main/terminal/git-cz) - Command-line tool to facilitate conventional commit messages.
